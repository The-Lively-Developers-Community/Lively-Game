# Lively-Game

## Alpha started: 5/9/2023 8:14 AM UTC

Alpha started, game making continued by Nina (GitHub: realguystuff)

Completed prototype without help :(

Please suggest by making an issue!

Until suggestions come, I will make this a Parkour game.

To modify the game yourself, please fork it then modify it, then create a PR containing what you've done to the code.

For best results, `git clone https://github.com/The-Lively-Developers-Community/Lively-Game/`, open up Unity 2021.3.24f1 (which is used to make this game), then modify it.
