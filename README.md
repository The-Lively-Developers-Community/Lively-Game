Prototype started, game making started by Nina (GitHub: realguystuff)

Please suggest by making an issue!

To modify the game yourself, please fork it then modify it, then create a PR containing what you've done to the code.

Until suggestions come, I will make this a Parkour game.

Online mode is expected to come by next year (or next next year).

Thanks! - Nina (realguystuff)
